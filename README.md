# amphisbaena
Personal project to write my own discovery protocol in python.
Amphisbaena is a greek mythological serpent that ate ants. I chose the name because I plan to use python and that I want each server in the discovery pool to be referred to as an ant. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphisbaena
